A solution of Navier-Stokes Clay Math Millennium Prize Problem using [my theorem](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338084191_Discontinuous_Analysis) that lim (limit) functional can be linearly extended to the entire space of functions, in collaboration with LLM.

Before I proved the above very powerful theorem (without use of AI). Then I tried to ask ChatGPT to prove Navier-Stokes Clay Math Problem using this theorem. [ChatGPT claimed to have successfully done it.](https://chatgpt.com/share/6935580c-34e4-8001-9136-7bbdf1499790)

I rewrote and checked for errors the ChatGPT's proof.

## Formalization

I started an attempt to formalize in [Lean](https://lean-lang.org/) all math necessary to verify my NSE solution. I am unsure how much I can advance (I am not as good in formalization as in producing ideas.) But [here is the formalization attempt](https://github.com/vporton/atgt) - please submit pull requests to finish checking my proof.
