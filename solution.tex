\section{Introduction}

This is an attempt to elaborate and check the proof by ChatGPT~\cite{navier-stokes-chat} of the Navier-Stokes Clay Math Millennium Prize Problem~\cite{navier-stokes-clay}, using the approach of generalized limits~\cite{limit} (more general generalized functions than distributions). In fact, ChatGPT didn't prove the energy inequality, but only existence of solutions, despite it claimed~\cite{navier-stokes-clay} a full solution.

So, I did a half of work (the theorem that $\lim$ (limit) functional can be linearly extended to the space of all functions and that on the space of extended limits all operations can be extended with preservation of all algebraic identities). And ChatGPT did a half of work (applied known methods with addition of my this theorem).

Extaordinary claims need extraordinary evidence. The claim is a partial Millennium Prize Problem solution. The evidence of this ``functional extension'' theorem is an extraordinary evidence, because it is a new very powerful theorem in general topology.

I have a trouble to understand the ChatGPT's proof, because while being the world-best expert in general topology, I am no expert in differential equations. So, you may help.

\section{Relation to distributions}

We define multiplication in the space of generalized limits, but well-behaved (fundamental theorem of calculus) integrals are in the space of distributions. (There are definite integrals in the space of generalized limits functions, but for them it seems that the fundamental theorem of calculus does not hold.) So, we need to immerse the space of distributions into the space of generalized limits, to freely operate with all three spaces: functions with real number values, distributions, and functions with generalized limit values.
\end{grayed}

\section{Problem statement}

\fxerror{ChatGPT got the problem statement~\cite{navier-stokes-clay} somehow wrong: It forgot non-zero external force.}

We are going to prove existece (in the sense of classical real-number solutions) and smoothness~($C^\infty$) of solutions to Navier-Stokes equations on $\mathbb{R}^3$.
Let $u:\mathbb{R}^3\times\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}^3$ and pressure $p(x,t)$.
\begin{align*}
\partial_t u - \nu\Delta u + (u \cdot \nabla) u + \nabla p &= 0;\\
\nabla \cdot u &= 0;\\
u({\cdot},0) &= u_0
\end{align*}
for viscosity $\nu>0$ and initial condition $u_0\in C^\infty$.

\section{Continuous functions on $\SUPER(\mathbb{R})$}

The following theorem allows to extend Lebesgue integrals to the space of generalized limits functions in an easy way:

\fxwarning{The domain of integration is not necessarily $\mathbb{R}^n$}

\begin{thm}
If a set $X$ is Lebesgue measurable and $f:X\to\SUPER(\mathbb{R})$ is continuous, then $\setcond{x\in X}{f(x)\ne 0}$ splits into Lebesgue measurable sets (``zones''), each zone $Z=\setcond{ka}{k\in\mathbb{R}}$ for some $a\in\SUPER(\mathbb{R})$, where for boundary points~$x$ of the zones it holds that $f(x)=0$ for all $x$ on the boundary, then $f=kg$ for some $k\in\SUPER(\mathbb{R})$ and $g:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Really, the distance between $c(a)$ and $c(b)$ for $\forall p,q\in\mathbb{R}:pa\ne qb$ is
\[ \inf_{p,q\in\mathbb{R}}|p a-q b| > 0, \]
if $p,q\ne 0$. Therefore boundaries of zones have $p,q=0$.

Subtracting boundaries from zones, we have zones (without loss of generality) being open sets and therefore Lebesgue measurable.
\end{proof}

\section{Lebesgue integrals}

\begin{rem}
(Lebesgue) integrals could be instead defined on the space of generalized limits functions \href{https://chatgpt.com/s/t_6937850a6b68819190a49e130f270ddb}{the same way} as Lebesgue integrals on the space of functions with real number values. This requires existence of (possibly infinite) supremum of a set of supersingularities. But for our purposes it is enough to define integrals on the space of continuous generalized limits functions, and this special case is much simpler to prove properties of.
\end{rem}

Define Lebesgue integrals on the space of continuous generalized limits functions as \[ \int_A f(x) dx = \sum_{Z\in S}k_Z\int_Z a_Z(x) dx \] where $S$~is a set of zones.

It is easy to show that this definition does not depend on the choice of~$k_Z$ and~$a_Z$.

\begin{thm}
If an integral is absolutely convergent on a measurable set, then it is convergent.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Obvious.
\end{proof}

\section{Properties of Lebesgue integrals}

\begin{thm}
The fundamental theorem of calculus holds for integrals of continuous functions on the space of generalized limits functions:

Let $a<b$ be real numbers. Then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $f\in L^1([a,b])$ (absolutely integrable by Lebesgue) and
\[ F(x) = \int_a^x f(t) dt \quad\text{for } x\in [a,b]\]
then $F$ is absolutely continuous on $[a,b]$, differentiable almost everywhere on $[a,b]$, and $F'(x) = f(x)$ almost everywhere on $[a,b]$.
\item $G:[a,b]\to\SUPER(\mathbb{R})$ is absolutely continuous on $[a,b]$, $G'$ exists almost everywhere, and $G'(x) \in L^1([a,b])$ and
\[ G(x)-G(a) = \int_a^x G'(t) dt \quad\text{for } x\in [a,b].\]
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Obvious.
\end{proof}

\section{Inhomogenious linear differential equations}

Theorem elaborated from \href{https://amirkdv.ca/files/inhom-pde.pdf}{here}.

\begin{defn}
\emph{Inhomogeneous linear evolution} with~$\Delta$ as the differential operator is
\begin{equation*}
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
(\partial_t - \Delta)u &= f;\\
u({\cdot},0) &= 0.
\end{aligned}
\right.
\end{equation*}
\end{defn}

\begin{thm}[First order Duhamel's principle]
Define auxiliary equations
\begin{equation*}
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
(\partial_t - \Delta)u_s &= 0;\\
u_s(x,s) &= f(x,s).
\end{aligned}
\right.
\end{equation*}
If the above family of equations have continuous in~$s$ solutions~$u_s(x,t)$ on supersingularities then the function
\[ u(x,t) = \int_0^t u_s(x,t) ds \]
is a continuous solution of the inhomogeneous linear evolution equation in supersingularities.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Continuity of $u_s$ makes the integral defined.

$u({\cdot},0) = 0$ is obvious.

By the Leibniz rule for an integral with moving upper limit,
\[ \partial_t u(x,t) = \partial_t \int_0^t u_s(x,t) ds = u_t(x,t) + \int_0^t \partial_t u_s(x,t) ds. \]

$(\partial_t - \Delta)u(x,t) = \partial_t \int_0^t u_s(x,t) ds - \Delta \int_0^t u_s(x,t) ds =
u_t(x,t) + \int_0^t (\partial_t u_s(x,t) - \Delta u_s(x,t)) ds = f(x,t)$, so $(\partial_t - \Delta)u = f$.
\end{proof}

\section{Rewriting in integral form}

% The below proof assures uniqueness only of continuous solutions (because the integral requires a continuous argument). I didn't prove uniqueness of solutions. However, if at some point of time~$t_{\operatorname{crit}}$, the solutions ``split'' into both continuous and non-continuous~$u$, then it contradicts to a known theorem\fxnote{Cite.}, stating that under initial condition at~$t_{\operatorname{crit}}$ solutions are preserved to be smooth\fxwarning{Seems to be a wrong logic, because at~$t_{\operatorname{crit}}$ this solution can take only the initial value.}, so by contradiction we have full Clay Math problem solution.

% If at some point of time~$t_{\operatorname{crit}}$ speed~$u$ becomes non-continuous,

% Let's introduce a Banach norm on~$\mathbb{R}^3$:\fxwarning{Unused.}
% \[ \lVert y\rVert_2 = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^3 y_i^2}. \]
% \[ \lVert y\rVert = \sqrt{\sup\setcond{\limsup_{x\to 0} f(x)^2}{f:\mathbb{R}^3\to\mathbb{R}, \lim_{x\to 0} f(x) = y}}. \]

Let denote Leray projection as~$\mathbb{P}$.

\begin{lem}
If $u$ is a $C^\infty$ super-sin\-gu\-lar function, then \[ e^{\nu (t-s) \Delta} \mathbb{P} \nabla \cdot (u \otimes u)(s) \] is also a continuous super-singular function for $s\in[0,t]$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
Obvious?
\end{proof}

\begin{defn}
I call the following defined for continuous functions taking supersingularities as values:
\begin{equation}
u(t) = e^{\nu t \Delta} u_0 - \int_0^t e^{\nu (t-s) \Delta} \mathbb{P} \nabla \cdot (u \otimes u)(s) ds.
\end{equation}
\emph{Supersingular integral solutions}\footnote{This formula is usually called \emph{mild (Duhamel) formulation}.} of Navier-Stokes equations.
\end{defn}

\begin{thm}
$C^\infty$ supersingular integral solutions of Navier-Stokes equations are exactly $C^\infty$ solutions of Navier-Stokes equations (without the requirement that~$p$ is $C^\infty$) taken on the space of supersingularities.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
It is known that \[ \widehat{\mathbb{P}f}(\xi) = \left(I - \frac{\xi \otimes \xi}{|\xi|^2}\right)\hat{f}(\xi). \]

$\mathbb{P}$ is obviously a linear operator.

$\mathbb{P}\nabla q=0$ for any scalar~$q$.

$\mathbb{P}$ commutes with $\Delta$ and with the heat semigroup: 
$\mathbb{P}\Delta=\Delta\mathbb{P}$,
$\mathbb{P}e^{\nu t \Delta}=e^{\nu t \Delta}\mathbb{P}$. (It's clear from these eqaulities in the classical case and linear combinations for the zones.)

Apply $\mathbb{P}$ to the PDE. Since $\mathbb{P}\nabla p=0$, we get
\[ \mathbb{P}\partial_t u - \nu\mathbb{P}\Delta u - \mathbb{P}((u\cdot\nabla) u) = 0. \]

Because $u$ is divergence-free and $\mathbb{P}$ equals identity on divergence-free fields, $\mathbb{P}u=u$. $\mathbb{P}$ commutes with $\partial_t$ and $\Delta$.\fxnote{Need a symbolic proof.}

Thus we have the consequence
\[ \partial_t u - \nu\Delta u + \mathbb{P}((u\cdot\nabla) u) = 0. \]

We can write the nonlinear term as a divergence of a tensor:
\[ \mathbb{P}((u\cdot\nabla) u) = \nabla \cdot (\mathbb{P}(u\otimes u)), \]
because $(u\otimes u)_{ij}=u_i u_j$ and $\nabla \cdot (\mathbb{P}(u\otimes u)) = \sum_j\partial_j (u_i u_j)$.

Thus the PDE becomes: \[ \partial_t u - \nu\Delta u + \mathbb{P}\nabla \cdot (u\otimes u) = 0. \]

Rewrite this PDE as a system:
\[ \partial_t u - \nu\Delta u = -F(t),\quad F(t) = \mathbb{P}\nabla \cdot (u\otimes u). \]

For the linear homogeneous heat equation $\partial_t v - \nu\Delta v = 0$ with initial data $v(0)=v_0$ the solution is $v(t) = G_t v_0$.\fxnote{Need to define $G_t$.}

For the inhomogeneous equation, the Duhamel principle (variation-of-constants formula) gives the unique solution as
\[ u(t) = G_t u_0 + \int_0^t G_{t-s} \bigl( -F(s) \bigr) \, ds = G_t u_0 - \int_0^t G_{t-s} F(s) \, ds. \]

Substituting the value of~$F$ gives exactly the mild formula.

Now prove in the converse: if continuous~$u$ satisfies the mild equation, then it satisfies the PDE and we can recover a pressure~$p$.

Assume $u$ to be a continuous supersingular function.

Differentiate the mild equation in~$t$. Use facts:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\partial_t(e^{\nu t \Delta}u_0) = \nu \Delta e^{\nu t \Delta} u_0$;
\item $\frac{d}{dt}\int_0^t e^{\nu (t-s) \Delta} F(s) ds = F(t) + \int_0^t \nu e^{\nu (t-s) \Delta} F(s) ds$.
\end{itemize}
Apply this with $F(s) = \mathbb{P}\nabla \cdot (u\otimes u)(s)$. Differentiating mild gives:
\[
\partial_t u(t) = \nu \Delta e^{\nu t\Delta}u_0 - \mathbb{P}\nabla \cdot (u\otimes u)(t) + \int_0^t \nu\Delta e^{\nu (t-s)\Delta} \mathbb{P}\nabla \cdot (u\otimes u)(s) ds.
\]
Group terms:
\[ \partial_t u(t) - \nu \Delta u(t) = \mathbb{P}\nabla \cdot (u\otimes u)(t). \]
This is exactly the projected PDE.

Since $\mathbb{P}$ annihilates gradients, applying $(I-\mathbb{P})$ to the PDE recovers the pressure gradient term: start from the original PDE form:
\[ \partial_t u - \nu\Delta u + (u \cdot \nabla) u + \nabla p = 0 \]

We already have projection $\mathbb{P}$ of this equation satisfied. To obtain $\nabla p$ explicitly, take divergence of the PDE:
\[ \nabla \cdot \bigl(((u\cdot\nabla)u) + \nabla p\bigr) = 0 \]
because
\[ \nabla \cdot (\partial_t u - \nu\Delta u) = \partial_t(\nabla\cdot u) -\nabla\Delta(\nabla\cdot u) = 0 \]
when $\nabla\cdot u=0$ initially and evolution preserves it (or check separately).\fxnote{More detailed proof.}

Use $\nabla \cdot \bigl(u\cdot\nabla)u\bigr) = \sum_{i,j}\partial_i\partial_j(u_i u_j)$. Thus
\[ -\Delta p = \nabla \cdot \nabla (u\otimes u), \]
i.e.
\[ -\Delta p = \sum_{i,j}\partial_i\partial_j(u_i u_j)\quad\text{(Poisson)}. \]
It is common knowledge that the Poisson equation's solution is $C^\infty$ if $u$ is $C^\infty$.

\fxwarning{Need a detailed solution in su\-per-sin\-gu\-lar case.}
Solve the Poisson equation for $p(\cdot,t)$ (up to additive function of $t$) by convolution with the Newton potential: for each fixed $t$,
\[
p(\cdot,t) = (-\Delta)^{-1}\nabla\cdot\nabla\cdot(u\otimes u)(\cdot,t) = \mathcal{R}_i\mathcal{R}_j(u_i u_j),
\]
where $\mathcal{R}_k$ are the Riesz transforms. This recovers~$p$ (up to function of time) and shows that
\[ \nabla p = (I-\mathbb{P})\nabla\cdot(u\otimes u), \]
so the full PDE
\[ \partial_t u - \nu\Delta u + \nabla p + \nabla\cdot(u\otimes u) = 0 \]
holds.

??
\end{proof}

\section{The sequence of approximate solutions}

Define the Picard iteration mapping~$T$ on time-dependent vector fields by
\begin{equation}
(\mathcal{T}v)(t) = G_t u_0 - \int_0^t G_{t-s}\mathbb{P}\nabla\cdot(v\otimes v)(s)ds.
\end{equation}
So, we have a sequence
\[ u^{(0)}(t) = u_0,\quad u^{(n+1)}(t) = (\mathcal{T}u^{(n)})(t). \]

Each element of this sequence is a continuous\fxwarning{Check!} supersingular function.

Define the solution $u(t)=L_{n\to\infty}u^{(n)}(t)$ as the limit of this sequence. The limit exists\fxwarning{Check!} because the sequence is can be calculated for each zone.

\section{Interchange of limit and integration}

Let $L$ be our extended limit. On each (closed) zone (a closed interval), $L$ is a bounded linear operator. Therefore (because it is a linear bounded operator\fxnote{Check that this is enough.} $L$~can be interchanged with integrals.)
It also maps\fxnote{Check.} absolutely convergent series to absolutely convergent series, therefore this extends to the entire closed interval. Thus we have:

\[ L_{n\to\infty}u^{(n)}(t) = G_t u(0) - \int_0^t L_{n\to\infty}(G_{t-s} \mathbb{P}\nabla\cdot(u^{(n)}\otimes u^{(n)})(s))ds = G_t u(0) - \int_0^t G_{t-s} \mathbb{P}\nabla\cdot(u\otimes u)(s))s, \]
that is it is a solution.

\begin{thm}
The heat semigroup $G_t$ is infinitely smoothing, that is $G_t f\in C^\infty$ for any $f:X\to\SUPER(\mathbb{R})$ for $t>0$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
It is known\fxnote{Reference.}, that $G_t$ is infinitely smoothing classical functions (and even distributions). So it is infinitely smoothing su\-per-sin\-gu\-lar functions at each ultrafilter\fxnote{Detailed proof} and therefore for $f:X\to\SUPER(\mathbb{R})$.
\end{proof}

Therefore the integral~$u$ is $C^\infty$.

\section{Futher directions}

I could argue, that the requirement of $C^\infty$ for physical reasonabliness is superfluous, because it is not used in the PDE derivation. So, the real physical problem remains unsolved: Is the solution unique if we require only existence of classical differential operators?

I also wonder why Clay Math considered physically irreasonable energy reaching infinity. The physically unreasonable assumption is not this but a force acting onto the fluid remaining the same no matter how the fluid moves. This may probably lead to infinite work, what is physically unreasonable.

So, whether the energy is uniformly bounded remains an open problem, without a clear physical hint.

Proving existence of classical $C^\infty$ solution moves the problem into classical analysis, where I don't claim to be an expert (despite my specialization in the university was ``math analysis'').
