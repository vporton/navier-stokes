# An attempted solution of Navier-Stokes Clay Math Millennium Prize Problem

An attempted solution of Navier-Stokes Clay Math Millennium Prize Problem using [my theorem](https://math.portonvictor.org/binaries/limit.pdf) that lim (limit) functional can be linearly extended to the entire space of functions, in collaboration with LLM.

Before I proved the above very powerful theorem (without use of AI). Then I tried to ask ChatGPT to prove Navier-Stokes Clay Math Problem using this theorem. [ChatGPT claimed to have successfully done it.](https://chatgpt.com/share/6935580c-34e4-8001-9136-7bbdf1499790)

Now I am elaborating and checking for errors the ChatGPT's proof.

I am the word-best expert in general topology, but no expert in differential equations. I need to study much during the way. So, I call you to help.
