\section{Introduction}

This is an attempt to elaborate and check the proof by ChatGPT~\cite{navier-stokes-chat} of the Navier-Stokes Clay Math Millennium Prize Problem, using the approach of generalized limits~\cite{limit} (more general generalized functions than distributions).

So, I did a half of work (the theorem that $\lim$ (limit) functional can be linearly extended to the space of all functions and that on the space of extended limits all operations can be extended with preservation of all algebraic identities). And ChatGPT did a half of work (applied known methods with addition of my this theorem).

I have a trouble to understand the ChatGPT's proof, because while being the world-best expert in general topology, I am no expert in differential equations. So, you may help.

\section{Relation to distributions}

We define multiplication in the space of generalized limits, but well-behaved (fundamental theorem of calculus) integrals are in the space of distributions. (There are definite integrals in the space of generalized limits functions, but for them it seems that the fundamental theorem of calculus does not hold.) So, we need to immerse the space of distributions into the space of generalized limits, to freely operate with all three spaces: functions with real number values, distributions, and functions with generalized limit values.
\end{grayed}

\section{Problem statement}

We are going to prove existece (in the sense of classical real-number solutions) and smoothness~($C^\infty$) of solutions to Navier-Stokes equations on $\mathbb{R}^3$.
Let $u:\mathbb{R}^3\times\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}^3$ and pressure $p(x,t)$.
\begin{align*}
\partial_t u - \nu\Delta u + (u \cdot \nabla) u + \nabla p &= 0;\\
\nabla \cdot u &= 0;\\
u({\cdot},0) &= u_0
\end{align*}
for viscosity $\nu>0$ and initial condition $u_0\in C^\infty$.

The solution constitutes an application for the Clay Math Millennium Problem Prize~\cite{navier-stokes-clay}.

\section{Integrals for supersingularities}

Let define definite integrals in the space of generalized limits functions as the difference of values of an antiderivative at the endpoints of the interval.

This definition suits only for integrals on a (closed) interval.

Each continuous function has an antiderivative and \href{https://chatgpt.com/s/t_69364f2479308191b79639101dbbfa48}{here} it's said that the terms under the integrals are continuous. The classic solution of the differential equations however, also require~$u$ to be continuous. So, this is not restrictive.

\section{Continuous functions on $\SUPER$}

The following theorem allows to extend Lebesgue integrals to the space of generalized limits functions in an easy way:

\begin{thm}
\fxerror{The theorem is wrong: Take $k=0$.}
If $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\SUPER(\mathbb{R})$ is continuous, then $f=kg$ for some $k\in\SUPER(\mathbb{R})$ and $g:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Split $\SUPER(\mathbb{R})$ into connected components with each one being~$c(a)=\setcond{ka}{k\in\mathbb{R}}$, where $a\in\SUPER(\mathbb{R})$.

Really, the distance between $c(a)$ and $c(b)$ for $\forall p,q\in\mathbb{R}:pa\ne qb$ is
\[ \inf_{p,q\in\mathbb{R}}|p a-q b| > 0. \]

So, due to continuity, all values of~$f$ lie in the same connected component.
\end{proof}

\section{Lebesgue integrals}

Denote Lebesgue integrals on the space of generalized limits functions \href{https://chatgpt.com/s/t_6937850a6b68819190a49e130f270ddb}{the same way} as Lebesgue integrals on the space of functions with real number values. This requires existence of (possibly infinite) supremum of a set of supersingularities.

Let $B$ be a set of supersingularities.\fxwarning{Elaborate the notation, prove details.}
\[ \sup B = \sup\setcond{\lim_{x\to 0} f(x)}{\lim_{x\to 0} f(x) \in B} \]

\begin{rem}
Lebesgue integral is infinite, if $\sup B$ wents infinite on at least one ultrafilter.\fxnote{Explain.}
\end{rem}

\begin{thm}
If an integral is absolutely convergent on a measurable set, then it is convergent.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
\href{https://chatgpt.com/s/t_6937889e364881919fce0669e53a3115}{The same proof} as for real numbers.
\end{proof}

\section{Properties of Lebesgue integrals}

\begin{thm}
The fundamental theorem of calculus holds for integrals of continuous functions on the space of generalized limits functions:

Let $a<b$ be real numbers. Then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $f\in L^1([a,b])$ (absolutely integrable by Lebesgue) and
\[ F(x) = \int_a^x f(t) dt \quad\text{for } x\in [a,b]\]
then $F$ is absolutely continuous on $[a,b]$, differentiable almost everywhere on $[a,b]$, and $F'(x) = f(x)$ almost everywhere on $[a,b]$.
\item $G:[a,b]\to\SUPER(\mathbb{R})$ is absolutely continuous on $[a,b]$, $G'$ exists almost everywhere, and $G'(x) \in L^1([a,b])$ and
\[ G(x)-G(a) = \int_a^x G'(t) dt \quad\text{for } x\in [a,b].\]
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}

\end{proof}

\section{Rewriting in integral form}

% The below proof assures uniqueness only of continuous solutions (because the integral requires a continuous argument). I didn't prove uniqueness of solutions. However, if at some point of time~$t_{\operatorname{crit}}$, the solutions ``split'' into both continuous and non-continuous~$u$, then it contradicts to a known theorem\fxnote{Cite.}, stating that under initial condition at~$t_{\operatorname{crit}}$ solutions are preserved to be smooth\fxwarning{Seems to be a wrong logic, because at~$t_{\operatorname{crit}}$ this solution can take only the initial value.}, so by contradiction we have full Clay Math problem solution.

% If at some point of time~$t_{\operatorname{crit}}$ speed~$u$ becomes non-continuous,

% Let's introduce a Banach norm on~$\mathbb{R}^3$:\fxwarning{Unused.}
% \[ \lVert y\rVert_2 = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^3 y_i^2}. \]
% \[ \lVert y\rVert = \sqrt{\sup\setcond{\limsup_{x\to 0} f(x)^2}{f:\mathbb{R}^3\to\mathbb{R}, \lim_{x\to 0} f(x) = y}}. \]

Let denote Leray projection as~$\mathbb{P}$.

\begin{defn}
I call the following defined for continuous functions taking supersingularities as values:
\[ u(t) = e^{\nu t \Delta} u_0 - \int_0^t e^{\nu (t-s) \Delta} \mathbb{P} \nabla \cdot (u \otimes u)(s) ds. \]
\emph{Supersingular integral solutions}\footnote{This formula is usually called \emph{mild (Duhamel) formulation}.} of Navier-Stokes equations.
\end{defn}

\begin{thm}
Doubly differentiable supersingular integral solutions of Navier-Stokes equations are exactly solutions of Navier-Stokes equations taken on the space of supersingularities.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
??
\end{proof}
